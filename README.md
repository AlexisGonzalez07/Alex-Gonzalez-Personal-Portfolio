# Alex Gonzalez Personal Portfolio

## Project Purpose

In this project, I was tasked with developing a personal porfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS. This project is designed to be a living document that will be updated and refined as I continue in my coding career.

## Tasks Completed

It was my responsiblity to develop the code and ensure that: 
1. CSS document and HTML document have logical and concise comments explaining the code

4. Sections of the website were responsive to user interactions such as clicks and hovers
5. Regular commits to Github and other coding best-practices are followed
